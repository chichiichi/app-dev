## Overview

The story begins during China's *Cultural Revolution* and spans decades, weaving together humanity's first contact with an alien civilization. The narrative explores what happens when Earth receives a message from ***Trisolaris***, a planet in a chaotic three-star system whose inhabitants are seeking a new home.

## Key Themes

The series delves into profound questions about:

1. Human nature and morality
2. Survival of civilizations
3. Our place in the universe
4. The ethics of betraying one's own species

Some characters become disillusioned with humanity and welcome the extraterrestrial contact, while others fight to defend Earth despite the seemingly impossible odds.

## The Science

One of the most fascinating aspects is the **"three-body problem"** itself:

- The impossibility of predicting three celestial bodies orbiting each other
- Creates extreme and unpredictable climate conditions on Trisolaris
- Forces the alien civilization to evolve in unique ways

### Advanced Concepts

* **Sophons**: Subatomic supercomputers that interfere with Earth's scientific progress
* **Dark Forest Theory**: A terrifying explanation for the Fermi Paradox
* **Dimensional Weaponry**: Physics-defying weapons that bend reality itself
